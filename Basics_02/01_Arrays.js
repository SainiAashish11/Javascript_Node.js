// Arrays : Data structure which stores various data types in a single variable
// It is resizable as well as mutable( values can be modified )
// Array indexing starts from '0'
// shallow copy(same reference of outer part only) : new array will also take reference to first array and changing one will modiy other as well
// deep copy( fully copied version) : both the arrays are different in terms of reference
const myArr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
